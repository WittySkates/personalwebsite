            This project was sponsored by Raytheon Intelligence & Space. The goal was to replace the
            existing end of life GUI that relied on Adobe Flash, which was deprecated in December
            2020 by developing a new front-end using a well-supported framework. The goal was to
            retain the functionality of the legacy GUI and improve on the design. The most important
            issue in the project was providing the functionality requested by the client in an
            intuitive and easy-to-use display. The team achieved this by developing the design in
            coordination with the liaison engineers and by incorporating extensive user experience
            testing throughout the development of the project. The largest risks involved data
            security and privacy. The application must be secure, so the team implemented best
            practices for security and work with the liaison engineers to ensure the application
            meet the security needs.
